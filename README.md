# Travel.ld Web App
**Problem Statement:** 
<br> While travelling to new cities, Google is the primary source of tourist destinations, restaurants, etc. There aren't popular solutions which tailor
experiences according to the users' preferences. The task is to create a personalized experience for users travelling to different cities. <br>

**Solution Devised:**
<br> To takle the problem of lack of personalized user experience, we devise a web solution that recommends places to go and things to do, to the users. 
To further enhance the user experience, we impart seamless Flight and Hotel bookings for our users so that they don't have to face any difficulty in this
area at all. We believe that behind a great User experience, lies many factors including designing good looking, user friendly, efficient and easy to use interfaces.
Therefore, keeping these points in mind, we have tried to create a web application, that can easily attract users and help them throughout their trip from
making bookings to giving efficient recommendations for exploration.
